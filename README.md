# This is where a readme is going to be :).

For now, try:

1. Building:

           ./bin/build.sh
   This requires a working mlton installation.

2. Running tests:

          ./bin/test.sh
   Requires ruby & powerbar gem.

3. Building plots.

          ./bin/plot.sh
   This requires ruby & gnuplot.
   The plots will be put to ./plot/out folder.
